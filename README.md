Navecita
========

Navecita is an unfinished Android game application (though executable and playable). 
I made it in order to learn as much I could about videogame development (in Android).

It is directly programmed with Android libraries, using no game development framework.
I did it this way so that I could learn the basics and see what happens behind the curtains when programming videogames.
It might look a simple game, but it is very interesting and not easy to program using no framework.

I took as a base "LunarLander" sample application from the Android SDK. 

Since I made for learning purposes, I have not created a full featured final version to publish.
To create a full game, now, I would use a game framework like libGDX or cocos2d-x.
